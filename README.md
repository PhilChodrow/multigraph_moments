# Moments of Uniform Random Multigraphs with Fixed Degree Sequences

*Phil Chodrow*

This repository contains software used in the manuscript. The mathematical core of the software is contained in the functions in `opt.py`. The additional scripts help primarily with evaluating the accuracy of these functions. There are notebooks to demonstrate how to use and generate figures from these functions as well. A good place to start is `demo.ipynb`.
